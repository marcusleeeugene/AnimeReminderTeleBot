## Technical Stuff:
1) The bot is deployed onto Heroku Server.
2) Threading is used to support multiple users each time they start the bot.
3) It saves the Animes and the details that each user is tracking to Google's Firebase Real-time Database.
4) The bot scrapes data using BeautifulSoup4 and Selenium from 9Anime to check if there is a new episode release.
